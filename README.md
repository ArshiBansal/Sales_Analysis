<h1 align="center">SALES REPORT DASHBOARD (2017–2020) - Power BI 📈🏪</h1>

# Introduction 🌟

This Power BI dashboard delivers a clear and interactive visualization of **retail and warehouse sales** data from **2017 to 2020**, offering stakeholders a comprehensive understanding of sales trends, supplier performance, and product category contributions. As my **second Power BI project**, it reflects continued development of skills in visual analytics, DAX, and data storytelling.

# Problem Statement ❓

In many organizations, raw sales data is underutilized due to a lack of accessible visualization. Business leaders often struggle to answer questions like:
- How are retail and warehouse sales trending over time?
- Who are the top suppliers contributing to total revenue?
- Which product types or items generate the most sales?
This dashboard helps solve these challenges by providing a dynamic interface for stakeholders to explore these patterns interactively.

# Data Source 📂

The dataset simulates real-world retail and wholesale transactions, and includes:
- Sales by Year & Month
- Sales Channels (Retail & Warehouse)
- Supplier Information
- Item Descriptions & Types
- Product Category Details

The data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Power BI Desktop.
